# MyNotes4Expressworks
This is a repository where I put my code for each challenge in expressworks from freecodecamp.com.

## 1. Installing expressworks command
$ git clone https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/fcc-expressworks.git && chmod 744 fcc-expressworks/setup.sh && fcc-expressworks/setup.sh && source ~/.profile

Unfortunately, this is not enough(A bug that hasn't been solved...).

$ nvm install v4.1

$ chmod 744 fcc-expressworks/setup.sh && fcc-expressworks/setup.sh && source ~/.profile

## 2. Solving challenges given in the workshop

Basically, just using process.argv list in the .js script.

## 3. Turning solutions into self project

Replacing process.argv list with specific path or file on the server.

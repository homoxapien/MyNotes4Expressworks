# MyNotes4Expressworks
This is a repository where I put my code for each challenge in expressworks from freecodecamp.com.

## 1. Installing expressworks command
>git clone https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/fcc-expressworks.git && chmod 744 fcc-expressworks/setup.sh && fcc-expressworks/setup.sh && source ~/.profile

Unfortunately, this is not enough(A bug that hasn't been solved...).

>nvm install v4.1

>chmod 744 fcc-expressworks/setup.sh && fcc-expressworks/setup.sh && source ~/.profile
